# ✈️ Flight Booking Chat Application

## 📌 Overview

A real-time chat application that enables users to interact with a flight booking assistant using natural language. The application integrates **Dialogflow ES** for natural language understanding and employs **WebSocket** for seamless, real-time communication between the frontend and backend.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 💬 Real-time chat interface for user interaction
* 🤖 Dialogflow ES integration for intelligent, contextual responses
* 🔌 WebSocket-based communication for instant message exchange
* ✈️ Flight booking assistant capable of answering flight-related queries

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, WebSocket (`ws` library)
* **NLP Engine:** Google Dialogflow ES (via Node.js SDK)

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MSamamah/flight-booking-chat.git
cd flight-booking-chat
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Dialogflow Credentials

* Place your Dialogflow service account JSON file (downloaded from Google Cloud Console) inside the project root directory.
* Rename it to `service-account.json` or update the path in `server.js` accordingly.

### 4. Run the Server

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will start on **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**.

### 5. Open the Application

* Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
* Start chatting with the flight booking assistant!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* The WebSocket connection is established **between the frontend and the Node.js server** to allow real-time communication.
* Dialogflow ES does **not** support WebSocket communication directly; the backend uses the Dialogflow SDK REST API to send and receive messages to/from Dialogflow.
* This approach ensures smooth real-time chat experience between the client and server while leveraging Dialogflow’s powerful NLP capabilities.
